# Python Programming Fundamentals

## Overview
This module covers fundamental programming concepts in Python, including conditional statements, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Topics Covered
- Conditions and branching
- Loops: for and while
- Functions: Defining and calling functions
- Exception handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes and objects

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use conditional statements and loops
- Write and use functions to organize code efficiently
- Handle errors using exception handling
- Implement object-oriented programming concepts

## Hands-on Labs
- Writing conditional statements
- Using loops for iteration
- Creating functions and handling exceptions
- Defining and using classes and objects

## Notes & Learnings
- The `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements control program flow.
- Loops help iterate through sequences efficiently.
- Functions allow code reuse and modular programming.
- Exception handling prevents program crashes due to errors.

## Next Steps
- Complete all exercises and quizzes for this module.
- Write small programs using loops and functions.
- Proceed to **Working with Data in Python**.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
