# APIs and Data Collection 

## Overview
This module explores how to collect data using APIs and web scraping techniques. It covers reading and processing various data formats, making API requests, and extracting useful information from web sources.

## Topics Covered
- Understanding APIs and how they work
- Making HTTP requests with Python
- Parsing JSON and XML data
- Web scraping with Beautiful Soup
- Handling different file formats for data collection

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Requests library
- Beautiful Soup
- JSON & XML parsing

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how APIs function and their role in data collection
- Use Python's `requests` library to interact with web APIs
- Extract and parse data from JSON and XML formats
- Implement web scraping techniques using Beautiful Soup

## Hands-on Labs
- Fetching data from an API
- Parsing JSON and XML responses
- Web scraping a website for data extraction

## Notes & Learnings
- APIs provide structured access to data over the web.
- The `requests` library is useful for making HTTP GET and POST requests.
- JSON is the most common format for API responses, and Python makes it easy to parse.
- Web scraping should be done ethically, respecting `robots.txt` rules.

## Next Steps
- Complete all exercises and quizzes for this module.
- Build a small project using an API for data retrieval.
- Proceed to **Final Exam and Course Completion**.
