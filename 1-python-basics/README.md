# Python Basics
## Overview
This module introduces the basics of Python programming. It covers fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, expressions, and string manipulation. By the end of this module, I was able to write simple Python programs and understand basic syntax.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to Python
- Data types: integers, floats, strings
- Variables and assignments
- Basic mathematical operations
- String manipulation techniques

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and use different Python data types
- Perform basic arithmetic operations
- Store and manipulate data using variables
- Work with strings effectively

## Hands-on Labs
- Writing my first Python program
- Performing arithmetic operations
- String formatting and manipulation

## Notes & Learnings
- Strings in Python are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation.
- Python uses dynamic typing, so you don't need to declare variable types explicitly.
- The `print()` function is used to display output in Python.

## Next Steps
- Complete all exercises and quizzes for this module.
- Experiment with Python code snippets to reinforce learning.
- Proceed to [Python Data Structures](../2-python-data-structures).

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
