# Python Data Structures
## Overview
This module explores Python data structures, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. These structures help store and manipulate data efficiently.

## Topics Covered
- Lists: Creating, modifying, and accessing elements
- Tuples: Immutable ordered collections
- Dictionaries: Key-value pairs for efficient lookups
- Sets: Unordered collections with unique elements

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and use different data structures in Python
- Perform operations on lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Use dictionaries for efficient data storage and retrieval

## Hands-on Labs
- Creating and modifying lists
- Working with tuples and dictionaries
- Performing set operations

## Notes & Learnings
- Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable.
- Dictionaries allow fast lookups using keys.
- Sets automatically remove duplicate elements.

## Next Steps
- Complete all exercises and quizzes for this module.
- Experiment with different data structures in Python.
- Proceed to **Python Programming Fundamentals**.
